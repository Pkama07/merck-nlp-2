Purdue Data Mine 22-23: Merck NLP
This project was developed with the Purdue Data Mine program for Merck. Leveraging Neo4j, AWS, React, and Regex, this tool allows users to upload Bioanalytical Procdure (BP) documents and store their graph database representations. Whenever a user wants to access BP files which contain information on a particular material, technique, value, or substance (e.g rat plasma, chromatography, etc.), they can search the term they are interested in and recieve a downloadable list of the corresponding BP files. This service is useful in expediting the drug analysis process, as it allows researchers to find the documents they want with little to no hassle.
